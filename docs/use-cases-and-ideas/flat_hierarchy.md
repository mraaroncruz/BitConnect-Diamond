I think that things like "ventures" and "companies" only exist because they were recently the most efficient way for people to pool their resources and work together towards common goals at a certain scale, and because you need to be as big as a company to justify the cost of jumping through the regulatory loopholes.

Now that finance is unshackled from the government's restrictions, we have much better tools for pooling resources: unrestricted financial derivatives.

The biggest advantage of the new system over companies is that each individual is in complete control of their own money. We are entering the trustless era.

under the old system you had a publishing company. They had a legal right to the book, and gave the author some money for every copy sold. The publishing company has investors who own it and trust managers to act wisely.

In the new system the book will be shared for free by torrent. The author will get paid before the book is published by an insured crowdfunding contract. No venture or company is involved.

Insured crowdfunding, which is a type of financial derivative, lets people pool their resources for common goals without trusting anyone. It allows us to pay for the production of goods or services without hiring anyone.

As an open source programmer, I expect to make my income from insured crowdfunding contracts. That way the money I am paid comes directly from the people my code benefits, and they each pay me exactly how much my software benefits them. I don't need a company or venture to employ me.

Prediction markets allow us to come to consensus about how money should be spent without relying on a manager or company to make the decision.
A decentralized world harnesses the wisdom of the crowd to make decisions.
