One of the most efficient ways of building a stable coin is to let the user hold whatever type of money they want for the duration of the contract. This only works for contracts that can be built as [options](options.md).

Another way to build a stablecoin is to make lots of financial derivatives to build a portfolio that maintains the same value with an asset that is stable.
