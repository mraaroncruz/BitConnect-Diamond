you don't need to know very much about git to program for Amoveo.

you will need a github account.  https://github.com/

once you have a github account, click the fork button on this page: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo

you should clone your own version from your profile on github with this command:
`git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/testnet.git`

that way you can make changes to the code and easily share it. And next time you apply for a software job, you can have this proof of work you did.

`git push origin master` is how you push the changes you made from your computer to your repository on your profile on github.

`git pull` is for pulling updates that are on github already.
