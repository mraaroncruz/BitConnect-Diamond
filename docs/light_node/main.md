Orders are either unmatched, or matched.
An unmatched order can be canceled at any time almost instantly, which means you get all your money back, and the trade does not get executed.
A matched order cannot be canceled, but you can sell it at the current market price by buying an order in the opposite direction, and then combining the two orders to recover your VEO.
